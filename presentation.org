* Carshare and ride services
# Contrast carshare and ride services in terms of features
** Carshare
 - Short-term rental; pay by the unit of time or distance (usually time)
 - Membership based; driven by member (license required)
 - Fixed stations or floating car location
 - Examples: Zipcar, Car2go, Cityhop?
** Ride services (when is a cab not a cab?)
 - Car comes with driver
 - Different (emerging) regulations than cabs
 - Dynamic pricing
 - Examples: Uber, Lyft, Sidecar


* Carshare and ride services cont...
** Common
 - Technologically mediated transactions (no hailing, no cash)

* From the user's perspective -- carshare
** Getting started / Enrollment
1. Sign up for membership account
2. Pay membership fee
3. Submit drivers license
4. (Select a PIN)
5. Provide credit card details to keep on file

* From the user's perspective -- carshare cont...
** Using carshare, Car2go style
1. Find, reserve nearby floating car from computer or smartphone (or
   be lucky and find an unreserved car on-street) >= 30 minutes prior
   to trip.
2. Unlock car with smart card / smartphone + PIN
3. Drive car to destination(s), end trip in the parking zone
4. System calculates the usage, bills credit card

* From the user's perspective -- carshare cont...
** Carshare, Zipcar style
1. Reserve car at fixed station location, can be well in advance,
   estimate time usage
2. Unlock car with smart card
3. Use car for allotted time period, end trip at trip origin.
4. System calculates usage, bills credit card

** Formulation rental arrangement has ramifications for use patterns

* From the user's perspective -- ride service
** Uber / Lyft
1. Sign up for membership account, provide credit card
2. +Hail car+ Set pickup location from smartphone app
3. Ride to destination, rate driver via smartphone

** Note: nowhere in any of these examples did we pay a driver or swipe a credit card at the time of service


* Supporting infrastructure of carshare and ride service
** Traditional infrastructure:
 - Roads, parking, ITS, etc.
** Technological infrastructure:
 - Networks---Wireless, car and user
 - GPS to track cars, you
 - Smartphones---most convenient package containing network
   hardware, GPS, interactive interface, contact lists
 - Computer servers
 - Payment card processors / financial networks
 
* Current status of carshare / ride service in Puget Sound - Travel Survey \parencite{PSRC:2014aa}
- 50,856 total trips observed in the survey[fn:: Special thanks to
  Suzanne Childress at PSRC for summaries of the survey statistics]
- 56 car share vehicle trips
- 58 Uber or Lyft trips
- 2 transit access trips with car share vehicle
- 5234 Taxi share - estimated daily person trips
- 6773 Car share - estimated daily person trips
- ~ 0.5% car share mode split (however, many in region don't
  necessarily have access)
- Car share and Taxi share highest in 25--34 age bracket, next highest
  35-44 bracket.

* Implications for transportation system
** Resource utilization / Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
** Civil society, privacy

* Resource utilization / TDM
** TDM premises
- Traditional solution to too many cars was to build more roads
- Demand (and latent demand) is larger than models assume, and
  outstrips roadway development
- Road building also not environmentally friendly
** TDM thus tries to do more with less
- Shift travel behavior from SOV to carpool, transit, bike, walk,
  telecommute, shift work schedules... *carshare / ride service*?
- Ensure alternatives to driving alone exist
- Try to make those alternatives competitive (money, time)
- Promote those alternatives

* Resource utilization / TDM cont...
** What exactly is being conserved?
- Cars! An underutilized asset.
- Land, for parking \parencite{Shoup:2005aa}. (The average car sits parked 95% of the time)
- Roadway capacity? Maybe... though beware the latent demand
** More importantly restructures mode choice




* Civil society -- upsides
- Economic opportunity for ride service drivers; low barrier of entry
  compared to traditional taxi
- Saves money for occasional drivers
- Uber claims fewer drunk driving incidents where Uber has launched\parencite{Uber:2015aa}
- All the aforementioned TDM benefits

* Civil society -- upsides cont...

* Civil society -- challenges 
- How are drivers treated by their corporate... bosses? Partners?
  - Are drivers entrepreneurs or employees?
  - Who controls pricing?
  - "Subcontractor piecemeal economy" \parencite{Stallman:2014aa}?
- Who is liable when something bad happens?
- Cheap, on demand transportation; must have smartphone
- Privacy

* Privacy
** On bike or foot
- Pretty anonymous, modulo stray pictures and facial recognition, or
  tracking devices
** In a private car
- license plate scanning identifies individual *cars* at various point
  locations.

* Privacy cont...
** Carshare / ride service
- Name, Billing address, Credit card number
- Location (continuous during trip); origin destination
- Time, combined with location could be used to build a profile of
  travel patterns.
- Info from smartphone? Watch those app permissions...
  - Contacts / address book
  - Wifi? Phone calls? Camera!?

* Privacy cont...
** Uber has been in the news a little lately...
- God mode
  - Stalking journalists \parencite{Hern:2014aa}
  - Stalking executives for launch party entertainment \parencite{Hill:2014aa}
- Rides of glory \parencite{Uber:2012aa}
- Giving access to rides database access to interview candidates \parencite{Timberg:2014aa}
- Not just privacy of riders \parencite{Taylor:2015aa}

* The impending future

** Self-driving cars
